# Bootstrap 3 Variable-Width Modal

I wanted to override the default Bootstrap modal so it's variable-width, and height-optimized. Since I'm using jQuery to set the max-height of the content area based on the browser dimensions, the modal will be only as tall as necessary, and will provide a scrollbar if needed.
